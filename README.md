# 1D Array Sorts
This rep has different java techniques(programs) for sorting arrays in ascending and descending order such as:
## 1. Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that compares adjacent elements of an array and swaps them if the element on the right is smaller than the one on the left. It is an in-place sorting algorithm i.e. no extra space is needed for this sort, the array itself is modified.
## 2. Exchange Sort
The exchange sort compares the first element with each following element of the array, making any necessary swaps. When the first pass through the array is complete, the exchange sort then takes the second element and compares it with each following element of the array swapping elements that are out of order.
## 3. Selection Sort
Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.
## 4. Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

This project was coded in java and compiled on BlueJ :)
